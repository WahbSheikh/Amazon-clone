External  library 
the code that is outside of our ptoject
we actually load this code into our project from internet
we can load it using a scropt type

why we use external libraries
let us share code
save time 
avoid duplicating work  



in delivery option 
the cheapest option to deliver is get product in 7 days 
3 days
then 1 
to get these datas
get today's date
do calculation 
(add 7 days)
display date in an easy to read format


we will be using DayJS an external library


Minification 
minimizing code to fit in


external libraries + js modules

we r loading the external libraries as script which can create conflicts

a better way to load external libraries is to use javascript modules
bcz a module will contain this code inside a file and any variables that are created inside the file will not conflict with anything outside the file

to use external libraries + js modules together we are going to use a special version of library called an ESM Version 
ESM = EcmaScript Module 
it is another name for js


a new syntax called Default export
another way of exporing something from a file
we can use it when we only want to export 1 thing from a file
